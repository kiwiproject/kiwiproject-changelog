Generates changelogs between two versions on GitHub.

## Building and running the shaded JAR

In order to run the changelog generator from the command line, you need to build the _shaded_ JAR which includes all dependencies.

The default Maven build does not include dependencies, so you need to run the build using the `shaded-jar` profile:

```bash
$ mvn package -DskipTests -Pshaded-jar
```

This will build the current SNAPSHOT build in the POM. If you want to build a specific version, for example the latest production release, just check out the corresponding release tag build the JAR:

```bash
$ git checkout <release-tag>
$ mvn package -DskipTests -Pshaded-jar
```

where `release-tag` is a valid tag, e.g., `v0.6.0`.

Make sure to check out the main branch once you've built the JAR, and maybe move the JAR somewhere else so it doesn't get deleted the next time a `mvn clean` happens.

Now you can run the JAR file with no arguments (or `-h` / `--help` ) to get usage information, for example:

```bash
$ java -jar <path-to-jar>/changelog-generator-0.6.0.jar --help
```

## Command line arguments

Here is a sample argument list that generates a changelog for the [kiwi](https://github.com/kiwiproject/kiwi) 
project (inside the kiwiproject organization on GitHub) for version 2.5.0.
It creates the changelog comparing from revision v2.4.0 to v2.5.0 using the given working directory.
It also maps several labels to categories, e.g., `-m bug:Bugs`
maps from the GitHub label `bugs` to the changelog category "Bugs" (you can also use `--mapping`).
The `--include-prs-from` (or `-i`) lets you include PRs from specific users, e.g. a bot like dependabot.
And finally, it uses the `-O` option (you can also use `--category-order`) to specify the order of
the categories in the generated changelog.

```
--repo-host-token [YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN]
--repository kiwiproject/kiwi
--previous-rev v2.4.0
--revision v2.5.0
--working-dir /home/users/bob/projects/kiwiproject/kiwi
-m bug:Bugs
-m "new feature:Improvements"
-m enhancement:Improvements
-m "dependencies:Dependency Updates"
-m "code cleanup:Assorted"
-m refactoring:Assorted
--include-prs-from dependabot[bot]
-O Improvements
-O Bugs
-O Assorted
-O "Dependency Updates"
```

In the `-m` options, the GitHub label comes first, then a colon, and finally the category name.
When a label or category name contains a space, you'll need to enclose the entire argument in
quotes.

The changelog that was produced using the above arguments is
[here](https://github.com/kiwiproject/kiwi/releases/tag/v2.5.0).

Note that you need a [GitHub personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
that has appropriate access to be able to read issues in the repository. 
You can supply this token using the command line (as shown above), or by setting an environment variable
named `KIWI_CHANGELOG_TOKEN`.

## Emoji support

You can also add some üå∂Ô∏è to your change logs using emoji.
In label-to category mappings and category order arguments, add emoji.
For example:

```
-m "bug:Bugs üêõ"
-m "new feature:Improvements üöÄ"
-m "enhancement:Improvements üöÄ"
-m "dependencies:Dependency Updates ‚¨ÜÔ∏è"
-m "code cleanup:Assorted üëú"
-m "refactoring:Assorted üëú"
--include-prs-from dependabot[bot]
-O "Improvements üöÄ"
-O "Bugs üêõ"
-O "Assorted üëú"
-O "Dependency Updates ‚¨ÜÔ∏è"
```

Make sure to use the same _exact_ same category names so that they are grouped together.

## External configuration

As of version 0.6.0, you can create a `.kiwiproject-changelog.yml`. Here is a sample configuration that is equivalent to the above command line arguments:

```yaml
---

categories:

  - name: Improvements
    emoji: üöÄ
    labels:
      - new feature
      - enhancement

  - name: Bugs
    emoji: üêõ
    labels:
      - bug

  - name: Assorted
    emoji: üëú
    default: true
    labels:
      - code cleanup
      - refactoring

  - name: Dependency Updates
    emoji: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
    labels:
      - dependencies
```

This file is searched for in the following order (relative to the directory where the changelog generator JAR is executed):

1. current directory
2. parent directory
3. user's home directory
