This directory contains a script to generate change logs and a JAR file
which performs the actual work.

The source repository is: https://github.com/kiwiproject/kiwiproject-changelog/

The default script is named .generate-kiwi-changelog, so you need to
use ls -a to see it (unless the name was changed during installation).

Run the script with `-h` flag to see usage information.
